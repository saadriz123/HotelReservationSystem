Welcome to GUI of a simple Hotel Reservation System. This project is designed solely for the purpose of SDAM Semester 2. ðŸš€âœ¨

Features include used :

1) Encapsulation: Ensured that the data and methods of each class are encapsulated appropriately using access modifiers.
2) Inheritance and Polymorphism:
3) Considered whether certain classes can inherit from others. For example, Person class for Customer and Admin.
4) Associations and Composition: Defined clear associations between classes. For example, a Booking "has" an Event and a Participant.
5) Error Handling: Implemented error handling, such as checking if a room is fully booked before allowing a customer to register.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, we hope you find value in using our project. Please feel free to explore the documentation, contribute, and share your feedback!
